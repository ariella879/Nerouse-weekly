This week I read [System76 introduces laptops with open source BIOS coreboot](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/coreboot-system76-laptops?utm_campaign=intrel)
where they talk about this idea where they have an open source BIOS, coreboot. Coreboot is an open source firmware that can replace your BIOS or UEFI and it focuses on
boot speed, security, and flexibility. Usually users have no access to their machine's BIOS but with coreboot users can modify and see
the source code. Coreboot is designed to boot your operating system with out any comprimise and without all the outdated code.
When I read this I thought back to [The Cathedreal and Bazzar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/index.html). I thought this
was an amazing thing becasue now users can modify their computers to do anything they want. Since the source code is open for everyone, people
can also contribute and modify it so it fits their needs. 

I also read the article [Open Source Firmware](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2019/10/239673-open-source-firmware/fulltext)
