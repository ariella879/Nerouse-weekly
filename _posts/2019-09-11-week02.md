# What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source
project? What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?

A suitable choice for my first contribution can be documenting on an open source project. Since I am fairly new to open source
programming, I would feel that commenting and looking over code that has been written before is a great way to start. It is
also a great way to familarize myself with the code and how things are structured in the code. Another suitable choice for my
first time contributing to a project is correcting typos. This is also another way that allows myself to read over the code
gain a good understanding of whats happening insdie the code. 

Some open source software I would be interested in are software that make your life easier. For instance, ad blockers are free
to use. I would love to contribute to that becasue, ad blockers help my browser stay neat and organized. Projects like that 
interest me the most becasue even though its not nesscary, it can enhance the user experience.
