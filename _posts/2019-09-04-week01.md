## Why did you decided to take a course in open source software?

When I started learning to code, a lot of people recommended me to look into open source software
so that I can practice and learn how to code better. At that time, I had no idea what they were talking about;
My top priority at the time was to print a triangle out with asterisks. But as I got more familiar with coding,
I learned that open source software is actually very useful. With open source software, I was able to take
code that someone else created and modify it to fit my needs. For instance, if I needed a function from a
open source program, I was able to just take the function out, change some things so that it fits my program
and it works. Another reason why I took this open source software development course was because I wanted to learn
how to contribute to other people work. I find that when I do try to contribute to someone work, I learn something new;
whether if its seeing how I can simplify my code so that its easier to read or a simpler process to do something.
I find that its easier for me to learn by coding and talking to people that have the same problems.
