title: Week 7

## For this week, your goal is to describe the project evaluation that you did. What was hard? what did you learn? Are you interested in the particular project that you evaluated now? What was the hardest task? Do not limit yourself to these questions

This week, during class, we paired up in groups and answered some questions about a project. We answered some general questions
about the project that gave us some insight on how the community of the project worked and some general information on the project.
Most of the information could be found on their github site with a bit of searching. This was surprising to me becasue just by looking
at the project and some digging you can actaully find out how the community is and find out how active the project is. I evaluated a project named
[Mumble](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble), which is a low latency, high quality voice chat software. Because the code is written
in C++, I really enjoyed that I was able to read through the code without looking up commands but although I was able to read the code, the 
code is not really well documented. There was no comments about the structure of the code in some of the code, so a first step if I wanted to
contribute to this project is comment on functions saying what it does.

## Summary
This week I looked at a few open source project I might have been interested in commiting to but I have not found any yet. 
I also evaluated mumble in class and learned a lot about mumble. I also learned that I was able to find out a lot of information about
the project just by digging and browsing around the git hub page.
